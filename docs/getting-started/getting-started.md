## Step 4: Customize Chart

Use the sidebar on the right of the screen to fully customize the look and feel of your chart.

Click the `Colors` tab and toggle the `Fill` switch on to fill the area under the lines in the line chart with color. You can change these colors with the color picker under the `Stroke` section.

Now click the `Dataset` tab and click the `Bezier Curve` checkbox beneath to smoothen the connecting lines.

Your chart should now look something like this.
